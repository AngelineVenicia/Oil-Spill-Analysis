Oil spills represent a critical environmental challenge with far-reaching consequences for marine ecosystems, coastal communities, and economic activities. The timely detection and effective management of oil spills are paramount to minimize environmental damage and ensure rapid response measures. Traditional methods of oil spill monitoring, such as aerial surveys and manual shoreline inspections, are limited in their coverage, timeliness, and accuracy. These methods often struggle to provide real-time data, leading to delayed responses and challenges in assessing the severity and extent of oil spill incidents. Additionally, the dynamic nature of oil spills, influenced by factors such as weather conditions, currents, and spill source characteristics, further complicates the accurate monitoring and prediction of spill trajectories.

The motivation behind this study stems from the pressing need for advanced technologies that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of oil spill detection, mapping, and response coordination. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have emerged as powerful tools in environmental monitoring, offering capabilities to analyse spatial data, integrate multiple data sources, and visualize complex information. Among GIS software solutions, ArcGIS stands out for its comprehensive suite of tools tailored for geospatial analysis and decision support. The integration of ArcGIS into the realm of oil spill detection presents an opportunity to leverage advanced spatial analysis techniques, remote sensing data, and real-time monitoring systems for enhancing detection accuracy and facilitating rapid response measures
